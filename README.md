# Neverl0ad3r-VPN
An exploit that lets you do whatever you want,by making your computer very laggy.Use it at your own risk! (HTML code)
I took an exploit that I made,I literally turned it into a data:URL
and then Copy-pasted the code so many times that the webiste got laggy.
It never loads.It took like 30 mins for it to load before finally getting a blocked page.
It is a site that holds Google in an iframe,put in in a data:URL,and
never lets the site load so that restrictions don't apply.
